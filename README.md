2. Generate a nx project template this will install all necessary dependencies and promts your preferences.

```bash
npx nx-quickstart@latest
```

3. Provide necessary database env variable

   - TypeORM

   ```env
   DB_HOST=
   DB_USER=
   DB_PASSWORD=
   DB_NAME=
   ```

4. Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Other Templates

[Prisma-Template](https://github.com/nx-quickstart/prisma-template)
[Typeorm-Template-Beta](https://github.com/nx-quickstart/typeorm-template)
[dotnet-template](https://github.com/nx-quickstart/dotnet-template)

This is the templates used for nx projects generation. We also support contribution to them , so feel free to check it.

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
